# neuronation

I decided to go with redux-toolkit, because it is more convenient.  
I created a new application instead of the original template, because I wanted to use Vite for developing the project.  

## How to run

- Installing dependencies 
```console
 yarn install
```

- Running the app (dev mode)
```console
 yarn dev
```
